# Doppelganger Protection in `ssv.network`

## 1. Introduction to Doppelganger Protection
Doppelganger (DG) protection is a security mechanism designed to **prevent a validator from accidentally running in two places at the same time.** This is critical in **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks** like Ethereum, where **double signing** can lead to **slashing penalties**.

### How Doppelganger Detection Works in Most Validator Clients (e.g., Lighthouse, Prysm)
Most validator clients, including **Lighthouse, Prysm, Teku, and Nimbus**, implement Doppelganger detection by:

1. **Checking validator activity**: The client queries the Ethereum network to check whether a validator has been recently active (i.e., seen in attestations network messages).
2. **If active, the client is terminated**: When a validator is found to be live elsewhere, **the client stops performing duties for all validators running on the same client**, preventing accidental slashing.
3. **If inactive, the validator temporarily disables signing**: The validator continues checking for activity until **a predefined number of epochs** pass without detection.

## 2. How is Doppelganger Protection Different in `ssv.network`?
In `ssv.network`, validators operate under a **distributed multi-operator model**, where **a committee of operators jointly signs** instead of a single validator client.
As a result, traditional Doppelganger detection methods used by solo staking clients need to be adapted to account for the distributed nature of signing.

### When is a Validator Marked as Safe in `ssv.network`?
A validator is **considered safe to sign** when:

1. **It has not been active on the Ethereum network for a predefined number of epochs**. If no recent attestations/proposals are found, the validator is **safe to sign**.
2. **Post-consensus quorum confirms validator safety**. If a validator participates in consensus and reaches the post-consensus step (i.e., a majority of operators in the validator‚Äôs committee agree via post-consensus partial messages quorum aka "decided"), then the validator can be marked as **safe** and start signing duties.
    - **Rationale**: This guarantees that the validator is **already actively running inside its `ssv.network` committee**, ensuring that the liveness status reported by the Beacon Node is likely due to its participation in `ssv.network` rather than another client.

## 3. Pros & Cons of `ssv.network` Doppelganger Protection

### üèÜ **How ssv.network Doppelganger Protection Differs from Solo Staking Clients**

| üü¢ **Pros (ssv.network DG)** | üî¥ **Cons (ssv.network DG)** | üèõÔ∏è **Solo Staking Clients (Lighthouse, Prysm, Teku, etc.)** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ **Prevents slashing** by ensuring validators do not sign while potentially active elsewhere. | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Operators running beacon nodes must enable liveness tracking** for Doppelganger protection to function properly. Example: Teku requires `--beacon-liveness-tracking-enabled=true`. | ‚ùå **Terminates the entire validator client process** upon detecting a Doppelganger, preventing further duties for all validators on that node. |
| ‚ö° **Minimizes validator downtime** by allowing a **post-consensus quorum** to determine safety, instead of waiting blindly for inactivity epochs. | üèóÔ∏è **Higher state-tracking complexity** due to integration with post-consensus logic. | ‚è≥ **Disables signing for all validators** and waits for a predefined inactivity period. |
| ü§ù **Works in distributed staking setups** where multiple operators sign jointly. **Each validator is evaluated separately.** If the BN fails to report accurate liveness, the validator can still be marked safe via **post-consensus operator agreement.** | ‚è≥ **Potential delays** if the post-consensus quorum does not finalize in time. ‚öôÔ∏è **Extra computational overhead**, as each validator's state must be tracked independently. | üì° **Solo staking clients fully depend on BN-reported liveness**, which can be inaccurate due to network issues. A single **faulty BN report** can cause unnecessary downtime. |
| üéØ **Granular control**: Instead of disabling all validators at once, **validators can be marked safe individually** when meeting safety criteria. | üîç **One or more operators failing to enable BN liveness tracking could affect accurate Doppelganger detection.** | ‚ö° **One faulty BN report can lead to unnecessary downtime for all validators on the client.** |

# 4. Addiotional considerations
### üí∞ Cost of Protection
- A validator will incur penalties due to 2-3 missed epochs during Doppelganger Protection.
- This trade-off is minor compared to the potential slashing penalties, making it an acceptable cost for securing validators.

### üõë Imperfect Nature of Doppelganger Protection
- Doppelganger detection relies on network communication and message propagation, which can fail under certain circumstances.
- The design must handle network latency and faults gracefully to avoid unintended validator downtime.

# 5. Implementation in `ssv.network`
The implementation follows a **modular and extendable design**, with:
- **`doppelganger.Provider` interface**: Defines required DG operations.
    ```go
    type Provider interface {
      // Start begins the Doppelganger protection monitoring, periodically checking validator liveness.
      // Returns an error if the process fails to start or encounters a critical issue.
      Start(ctx context.Context) error
  
      // CanSign determines whether a validator is safe to sign based on Doppelganger protection status.
      // Returns true if the validator has passed all required safety checks, false otherwise.
      CanSign(validatorIndex phase0.ValidatorIndex) bool
  
      // MarkAsSafe marks a validator as safe for signing, immediately bypassing further Doppelganger checks.
      // Typically used when a validator successfully completes post-consensus partial sig quorum (attester/proposer).
      MarkAsSafe(validatorIndex phase0.ValidatorIndex)
  
      // RemoveValidatorState removes a validator from Doppelganger tracking, clearing its protection status.
      // Useful when a validator is no longer managed (validator removed or liquidated).
      RemoveValidatorState(validatorIndex phase0.ValidatorIndex)
    }
    ```
- **`handler` struct**: Implements liveness tracking and post-consensus validation.
- **`NoOpHandler`**: A **noop implementation** when the feature is disabled.
- **`doppelgangerState` struct**: Tracks each validator‚Äôs safety status.
    ```go
    type doppelgangerState struct {
        remainingEpochs phase0.Epoch // The number of epochs that must be checked before it's considered safe.
    }
    ```
- **Beacon node integration**: Uses `ValidatorLiveness()` API for detection.
- **Post-consensus safety checks**: Validators may be marked safe based on post-consensus quorum instead of waiting full epochs.

## Key Changes in Codebase

### 1. Beacon Node Client
- Updated `goclient.MultiClient` to implement `ValidatorLivenessProvider`.
- Added `ValidatorLiveness()` method to `goclient`.

### 2. CLI Configuration (`cli/operator/node.go`)
- Added a **CLI flag** to enable or disable Doppelganger protection:
    ```go
      EnableDoppelgangerProtection bool `yaml:"EnableDoppelgangerProtection" env:"ENABLE_DOPPELGANGER_PROTECTION" env-description:"Flag to enable Doppelganger protection for validators."
    ```

- If disabled, a `NoOpDoppelgangerHandler` is used.

### 3. Validator State Tracking (`doppelganger/doppelganger_state.go`)

- Introduced constants:
    ```go
    // initialRemainingDetectionEpochs represents the starting number of epochs
    // a validator must pass without liveness detection before being considered safe to sign.
    const initialRemainingDetectionEpochs phase0.Epoch = 2
    ```

- Refined safety check logic:
    ```go
    // detectedAsLive returns true if the validator was previously marked as live on another node via liveness checks.
    // This means the validator should not be trusted for signing, as it indicates potential duplication.
    func (ds *doppelgangerState) detectedAsLive() bool {
        return ds.remainingEpochs == goclient.FarFutureEpoch
    }
  
    // markAsLive marks the validator as detected live on another node via liveness checks.
    // This means the validator should not be trusted for signing, as it indicates potential duplication.
    // The remaining epochs are set to FarFutureEpoch to ensure it is not considered safe until explicitly reset.
    func (ds *doppelgangerState) markAsLive() {
      ds.remainingEpochs = goclient.FarFutureEpoch
    }
    ```


### 4. Doppelganger Service (`doppelganger/doppelganger.go`)
- ![DG monitoring cycle](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1hCYQG9kg.png)

- üîÑ Liveness Monitoring & State Tracking
  The Doppelganger Monitoring Process is a crucial mechanism that runs every slot to keep the Doppelganger state map (doppelgangerState) up-to-date.

    1. The `handler` continuously monitors validators by running every slot.
    2. it queries the `ValidatorProvider` to fetch currently participating validators for the operator.
    3. The `Doppelganger` state map is updated accordingly.
    ```go
    validatorsState:  make(map[phase0.ValidatorIndex]*doppelgangerState)
    ```
    4. The map acts as the backbone for the DG protection mechanism, meaning
       If a validator is not found in the map, it is not safe to sign

    ```go
    func (h *handler) Start(ctx context.Context) {
      h.logger.Info("Doppelganger monitoring started")
      ticker := h.slotTickerProvider()

      for {
          select {
          case <-ctx.Done():
              return
          case <-ticker.Next():
              h.checkLiveness(ctx)
          }
      }
    }
    ```

- **Liveness check before allowing signing:**
    ```go
    func (h *handler) checkLiveness(ctx context.Context) {
        validatorsToCheck := make([]phase0.ValidatorIndex, 0, len(h.validatorsState))
        for validatorIndex, state := range h.doppelgangerState {
            if state.requiresFurtherChecks() {
                validatorsToCheck = append(validatorsToCheck, validatorIndex)
            }
        }

        if len(validatorsToCheck) == 0 {
            h.logger.Debug("No validators require liveness check")
            return
        }

        livenessData, err := h.beaconNode.ValidatorLiveness(ctx, epoch, validatorsToCheck)
        if err != nil {
            h.logger.Error("Failed to obtain validator liveness data", zap.Error(err))
            return
        }

        h.processLivenessData(livenessData)
    }
    ```

- **Processing Liveness Data in doppelgangerHandler**
  One of the most critical parts of Doppelganger Protection in `ssv.network` is the **processing of validator liveness data**. This ensures that validators transition safely from a potentially unsafe state to a safe signing state.
    ```go
    for _, response := range livenessData {
        state, exists := h.validatorsState[response.Index]
        if !exists {
            continue
        }

        if response.IsLive {
            // Mark the validator as live since it was detected producing messages on another node.
            // This ensures it remains unsafe for signing until explicitly reset.
            state.markAsLive()
            continue
        }

        // If the validator was previously marked as live (detected as active on another node),
        // but is now considered inactive, we reset the detection period to ensure safety.
        // Since we just checked for liveness and found it inactive, we reduce the detection period by 1
        // so that it gets checked again in the next epoch before being marked safe.
        if state.detectedAsLive() {
            state.remainingEpochs = initialRemainingDetectionEpochs - 1
            continue
        }

        state.decreaseRemainingEpochs()
        if state.requiresFurtherChecks() {
            h.logger.Debug("Validator still requires further checks")
        } else {
            h.logger.Debug("Validator is now safe to sign", fields.ValidatorIndex(response.Index))
        }
    }
    ```

### 5. Event Handling (`eth/eventhandler/handlers.go`)
- **Removes validators from the state when they are removed/liquidated:**
    ```go
    func (eh *EventHandler) handleValidatorRemoved(txn basedb.Txn, event *contract.ClusterValidatorRemoved)   {
      eh.doppelgangerHandler.RemoveValidatorState(event.ValidatorIndex)
    }

    func (eh *EventHandler) handleClusterLiquidated(txn basedb.Txn, event *contract.ClusterLiquidated) {
      for _, share := range toLiquidate {
          eh.doppelgangerHandler.RemoveValidatorState(share.ValidatorIndex)
      }
    }
    ```

### 6. Committee/Proposer Runners (`protocol/v2/ssv/runner/committee.go(proposer.go)`)

- üö´ Prevents attestation/proposal signing if Doppelganger check is pending
    ```go
    if !doppelgangerHandler.CanSign(proposerDuty.ValidatorIndex) {
		logger.Warn("Signing not permitted due to Doppelganger protection", fields.ValidatorIndex(duty.ValidatorIndex))
	}
    ```

- ‚úÖ Marks validator as safe after post-consensus partial messages quorum
    ```go
    doppelgangerHandler.MarkAsSafe(validator)
    ```

# 7. Summary & Final Thoughts
This implementation ensures **security, flexibility, and efficient liveness tracking** while **minimizing validator downtime**. Unlike traditional **solo validator clients**, `ssv.network` leverages **post-consensus quorum** to **safely mark validators as active**, reducing unnecessary waiting time.

This is a **significant enhancement** over traditional **Ethereum staking models** and provides **a secure, distributed mechanism for slashing prevention** while keeping validators online efficiently. üöÄ
